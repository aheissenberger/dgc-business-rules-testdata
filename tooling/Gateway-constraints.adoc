= Gateway constraints

The constraints on the JSON (payload) of the upload of a validation rule (after checking the signer's certificate) are the following:

[cols="1,4a,4a"]
|===
| reason code | constraints | message

| `UPLOADER_CERT_CHECK_FAILED`
| signer certificate must be known under authenticated country code
| Could not find _upload_ certificate with hash <signer certificate's thumbprint> and country <authenticated country code>

| `INVALID_JSON`
| parsable as JSON
| JSON could not be parsed

|
| validates against JSON Schema for Rule
| JSON does not align to Validation Rule Schema: <comma-separated list of validation violations' messages>

| `INVALID_RULE_ID`
| head fragment of `Identifier` must match `CertificateType`
| ID must start with <type abbrev.> for <certificate type> Rules

|
| `Identifier` of Acceptance rules can't start with `IR`
| Acceptance Rule Rule-ID requires prefix other than IR.

|
| `Identifier` of Invalidation rules must start with `IR`
| Invalidation Rule Rule-ID requires IR prefix.

| `INVALID_COUNTRY`
| `Country` code must match authenticated country code
| Country does not match your authentication.

|
| country code in `Identifier` (2nd fragment) must match authenticated country code
| Country Code in Identifier does not match country.

| `INVALID_VERSION`
| new `Version` must be greater (according to semver) than the most recent version (if that exists)
| Version of new rule (<new version>) needs to be greater then old version (<old version>)

| `INVALID_TIMESTAMP`
| `ValidFrom` needs to be before `ValidTo`
| ValidFrom (<(val)>) needs to be before ValidTo (<(val)>).

|
| `ValidFrom` must be no more than 2 weeks from now
| ValidFrom (<(val)>) cannot be more than 2 weeks in future.

|
| `ValidFrom` must be at least 48 hours from now
| ValidFrom (<(val)>) needs to be at least 48h in future for Acceptance Validation Rules

|
| `ValidFrom` must be in the future for Invalidation rules
| ValidFrom (<(val)>) needs to be in future for Invalidation Rules

|
| duration of validity must be at least 72 hours
| Rule Validity must be at least 72h but is %dh

|
| new `ValidFrom` can't be before that of the most recent version (if that exists)
| ValidFrom (<(current val)> needs to be after or equal to ValidFrom (<(previous val)> of previous version of the rule.

|===

These constraints are checked in this order.
Only the first violation is reported.

Reason codes and Java methods are currently 1-to-1:

|===

| Java method | reason code

| `contentCheckUploaderCertificate`
| `UPLOADER_CERT_CHECK_FAILED`

| `contentCheckValidJson`
| `INVALID_JSON`

| `contentCheckRuleIdPrefixMatchCertificateType`
| `INVALID_RULE_ID`

| `contentCheckUploaderCountry`
| `INVALID_COUNTRY`

| `contentCheckVersion`
| `INVALID_VERSION`

| `contentCheckTimestamps`
| `INVALID_TIMESTAMP`

// TODO  mention API doc + HTTP error codes?

The authenticated country code and signer certificate's thumb print are request parameters of the HTTP POST endpoint.
